Hi everyone,

I am looking forward to working with you next week as part of the MICRBIOL 612.1 module on reproducible research. There are two papers that I'd like you to read ahead of time...

Ravel J, Wommack KE. All hail reproducibility in microbiome research. Microbiome. 2014 Mar 7;2(1):8. doi: 10.1186/2049-2618-2-8.
https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-2618-2-8

Noble WS. A quick guide to organizing computational biology projects. PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Jul;5(7):e1000424. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424.

[ Include the mBio wrap up from the symposium ]

Please download and install the following prior to the workshop. I'll try to be there a bit early if people need help installing stuff.


* R       http://cran.rstudio.com
* RStudio http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
* Atom    https://atom.io

	Download the Git for Windows installer.
	Run the installer and follow the steps bellow:
	Click on "Next".
	Click on "Next".
	Keep "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" selected and click on "Next". If you forgot to do this programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.

	If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
	Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type cmd and press [Enter])
	Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:
	setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"
	Press [Enter], you should see SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.
	Quit command prompt by typing exit then pressing [Enter]
