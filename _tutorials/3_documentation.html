## Where we're going

* Documentation
* Keep raw data raw
* Data organization as a form of documentation
* Script everything
* Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
* Automation
* Transparency

???

All of these have some aspect of documentation baked into them.

---

## Where have we seen the importance of documentation already?
--

* ORCID provides a universal way to connect to someone
* Data description on FigShare dataset
* R markdown documents from Meadows et al.
* Project description on GitHub
* Project license
* README.md exercise
* Commit messages

---

## What makes a README.md useful?

* Examples
	* [Meadows et al. *Microbiome* study](https://github.com/jfmeadow/Meadow_etal_Surfaces/blob/master/README.md)
	* [Sze et al. *mBio* study](https://github.com/SchlossLab/Sze_Obesity_mBio_2016/blob/master/README.md)
	* [Westcott & Schloss *mSphere* study](https://github.com/SchlossLab/Westcott_OptiClust_mSphere_2017/blob/master/README.md)
* Questions
  * What do you notice about these?
  * What else would you like to see?
	* How would you change the README you wrote for the paper airplane example?

???

* These three examples span a spectrum from minimalistic to more complex
* Documentation is frequently a thankless task that no one wants to spend time on when they could be analyzing data and writing a manuscript

---

## Basic documentation

* `README.md` in root of project directory provides a navigation to anyone coming to your project
???
Important to note that every directory can/should have a README.md file that outlines what is in the directory and where it came from
--

* GitHub automatically shows the `README.md` file when you open the repository's webpage
--

* Useful to provide directory structure so newbie knows where everything is (or should be)
--

* Specify software dependencies, versions, and where they should be installed
--

* Give instructions on how someone would enter project or what they should do

---

## Keep raw data raw

* By keeping a raw version of your data you can always start over - you can always go back to a blank page.

--

* Have you ever accidentally sorted a spreadsheet by one column when you meant to sort by all of them?

---

## Data organization as a form of documentation

* Ever see someone's computer desktop and see 1000 files?
  * How efficiently can they access information?
  * What's the likelihood that they get lost? in six months?
  * How likely are they to teach you their "system"?
* Separate directories for code, data, figures, tables, documents makes it very clear where different types of files should be located

???

One way to enforce that raw data stay raw, is to put them into a directory for raw data

---

## Script everything/Don't Repeat Yourself

* Your scripts become the lens that you and others can use to see how you have analyzed your data

--
* Your instructions become better as you become more explicit

--
* If you cannot manually manipulate the raw data then you have to be explicit in how you document your processing of data

--
* Your scripts must be commented to make it easy for you (in six months) and others to understand

---

## Automation

* Automation helps to keep track of the ordering and maintenance of dependencies

--
* If you added more data, how difficult would it be for you to update your analysis? Would you remember all of the steps?

--
* In large and complex analyses, it becomes easy to lose track of where you are in the analysis

--
* Often an analysis will involve multiple steps with several sub-analyses depending on the results of a prior analysis

---

## Transparency

* How well are you going to document your analysis if you know that someone else might look back at what you have done?

--
* By letting others see how and why you have done things, you increase the likelihood that they will build off of what you have done

--
* Science only moves forward when others can build off of our workflows

---

## Plain text documentation

* Places emphasis on writing text, rather than formatting
* Plain text can be tracked with version control systems (coming attraction...)
* Anyone can read it - you don't need expensive software licenses
* We can use code to generate text

---

## Self-documenting directory and file names

* NO SPACES in directory or file names
  * `raw_data`, `build_figure_1.R`
  * `RawData`, `BuidFigure1.R`
  * not: `raw data`, `build figure 1.R`
--

* Be descriptive, atomic, and logical
  * `data/raw`, `data/mothur`
  * not: `stuff`, `data_raw`, `data_mothur`

---

## Self-documenting code

* Pick meaningful variable/function names in your scripts
* Choose a casing strategy and be consistent in using it:
	* `snake_case_is_popular` (easier to read)
	* `camelCaseIsPopular` / `CamelCaseIsPopular`
* Avoid `.`'s, `-`'s and other symbols
* Variable grammar:
  * nouns: variables (`sequence`)
  * verbs: functions (`cluster_sequences`)
  * logicals: questions (`is_sequence`)

---

## Comment your code

* Self-documenting code is insufficient
--

* The top of a script file should explain what the script does and describe the expected inputs and outputs
* More complex functions should list the inputs and outputs
* Use comments to describe what a line of code should be doing and why

---

## Exercise: Comment my code

* Go to the repository for the [Kozich et al. *AEM* study](https://github.com/SchlossLab/Kozich_MiSeqSOP_AEM_2013/blob/master/code/plot_nmds.R)
* Copy and paste the R script into RStudio and save the file
* Comment the code to indicate what is going on and where you have potential questions
* At the top of the file write your assessment of how readable the code is and if there is anything about the code you might change
* Compare your code to your neighbor
* Email your commented version of the file to me
