## Learning goals
* **Primary:** Automate an analysis with Makefiles


--

* **Secondary:**

	*
	*
	*

---

## Learning outcomes

*

---

## Driver script: Refresher from Noble

* "Record every operation that you perform"
* "Comment generously"
* "~~Avoid~~[DO NOT] editing intermediate files by hand"
* Use a driver script to centralize all processing and analysis
* "Use relative pathways [relative to the project root]"
* "Make the script restartable"

.footnote[[Noble 2009 *PLoS Comp Biol*](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)]

???

* We said we'd come back to the last point - make the script restartable

---

## Case study

You have finished `analysis_driver.bash` and are happy that you have automated your analysis. Consider the following...

* The mothur developers put out a new release of mothur
* There's a new version of the RDP classification database
* You decide to use the greengenes reference taxonomy
* You modify the color scheme for the ordination
* You've been persuaded to generate an animated version of the figure

---

## The mothur developers put out a new release of mothur

--

* Download new version of mothur (explicit)
* Regenerate `silva.seed.align` (explicit)
* Rerun `get_good_seqs.batch` (explicit)
* Rerun `get_error.batch` (explicit)
* Rerun `get_shared_otus.batch` (explicit)
* Rerun `get_nmds_data.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun R code to generate figure (implicit)
* Regenerate `manuscript.pdf` (implicit)

---

## There's a new version of the RDP classification database

--

* Download new version of database (explicit)
* Rerun `get_good_seqs.batch` (explicit)
* Rerun `get_error.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun `get_shared_otus.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun `get_nmds_data.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun R code to generate figure (implicit)
* Regenerate `manuscript.pdf` (implicit)

---

## You decide to use the greengenes reference taxonomy

--

* Download new version of database (explicit)
* Rerun `get_good_seqs.batch` (explicit)
* Rerun `get_error.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun `get_shared_otus.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun `get_nmds_data.batch` (implicit)
* Rerun R code to generate figure (implicit)
* Regenerate `manuscript.pdf` (implicit)

---

## You modify the color scheme for the ordination

--

* Rerun R code to generate figure (explicit)
* Regenerate `manuscript.pdf` (implicit)

---

## You've been persuaded to generate an animated version of the figure

--

* Write and run new R script (explicit)
* Regenerate `manuscript.pdf` (maybe)

---

## Dependency hell

* All of these dependencies are difficult to keep track of
* The situation only worsens as the analysis becomes more complicated
* You could use if statements using `bash` that checks time stamps
* Make

---

## Make

* Developed by Stuart Feldman in 1977 as a Bell Labs summer intern
* The goal was to have a tool for compiling software
* People generally hate make – hence the knock offs
* Recognize that using it for data analysis wasn't the original intent
* Hard to do much better!

---

## Primary use case

Don’t want to recompile an entire program for every change, so only compile what changed and what depends on that change

--

<br>
## Our use case

Don't want to re-run or re-download files that require a lot of time to generate, so only rebuild files that depend on that change

---

## Motivation

* I will repeat various steps in an analysis multiple times
* The end product is a data-heavy paper written in Rmd
* Each step of the analysis may be slow
* There are a lot of steps
* Analysis run on an HPC, so it needs to be scripted
* Want to make it possible for others (including me!) to replicate what I’ve done

---

## Example: Predicting age based on name

## Reactions

* What about my kids’ names?
* This would be cool as a Shiny app
* This was done in 2013, what about 2017?
* What if we had similar data from Canada?
* Can I replicate their analysis?

* R! Open science! :)
* Poor organization :(
* Script doesn’t produce the plots from this article :)

---

## So I did it for them...

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pschloss/make_tutorial.git
$ cd make_tutorial
$ bash baby_name_analysis.bash
```

<br>
* My [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pschloss/make_tutorial)
* Note that this is being driven by a single bash file
* It is a mixture of bash commands (e.g. curl, unzip) and R calls

Pretty good documentation here, eh?

.right[And it just works!]

???

Need to convert our bash file to a Makefile

---

## Makefile structure

* A makefile is a series of rules that contain *commands* for processing the *dependencies* to create the *targets*

```bash
data/processed/all_names.csv : code/concatenate_files.R $(YOBTXT)
	R -e "source('code/concatenate_files.R')"
```
--
* Target: stuff to the left of the `:` (`data/processed/all_names.csv`)
* Dependencies: stuff to the right of the `:` (`code/concatenate_files.R`)
* Commands:<br>
`	R -e "source('code/concatenate_files.R')"`

---

## Important point

```bash
data/processed/all_names.csv : code/concatenate_files.R $(YOBTXT)
	R -e "source('code/concatenate_files.R')"
```

* The second line is inset by a *TAB*, not spaces

--

<br>
* Can generate `data/processed/all_names.csv` with...

```bash
make data/processed/all_names.csv
```

---

## Let's convert to a Makefile

```bash
# Renders an Rmarkdown file that creates various plots  and
# provides an entertaining color commentary
# Depends on:	data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv
#							code/plot_functions.R
# Produces:		family_report.html
R -e "library(rmarkdown); render('family_report.Rmd')"
```

<br>
How would you write this as a rule?
Note that you can extend lines with a `\`

--

```bash
# Renders an Rmarkdown file that creates various plots  and
# provides an entertaining color commentary
# Depends on:	data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv
#							code/plot_functions.R
# Produces:		family_report.html
family_report.html : family_report.Rmd\
					code/plot_functions.R\
					data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv
	R -e "library(rmarkdown); render('family_report.Rmd')"
```

Copy and paste this into `Makefile`

---

## Try it out


```bash
$ make family_report.html
make: `family_report.html' is up to date.
```

---

## Next...

```bash
# Generate counts of total and living people with each name
# Depends on:	data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv
#							data/processed/all_names.csv
#							code/get_total_and_living_name_counts.R
#	Produces:		data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv
R -e "source('code/get_total_and_living_name_counts.R')"
```

<br>
How would you write this as a rule?

--

```bash
# Generate counts of total and living people with each name
# Depends on:	data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv
#							data/processed/all_names.csv
#							code/get_total_and_living_name_counts.R
#	Produces:		data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv

data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv : code/get_total_and_living_name_counts.R\
													data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv\
													data/processed/all_names.csv
	R -e "source('code/get_total_and_living_name_counts.R')"
```

--

<br>
Paste it into the head of `Makefile` and build the target

---

## Getting the hang of this?

```bash
# Fills in missing data from annual survivorship data
# Depends on: data/raw/alive_2016_per_100k.csv
#							code/interpolate_mortality.R
#	Produces:		data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv
R -e "source('code/interpolate_mortality.R')"
```

<br>
How would you write this as a rule?

--

```bash
# Fills in missing data from annual survivorship data
# Depends on: data/raw/alive_2016_per_100k.csv
#							code/interpolate_mortality.R
#	Produces:		data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv
data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv : data/raw/alive_2016_per_100k.csv\
										code/interpolate_mortality.R
	R -e "source('code/interpolate_mortality.R')"
```

<br>
Paste it into the head of `Makefile` and build the target

---

## The next step is a little harder

* We need to generate a large number of dependencies
* `make` has built in functions that allow you to construct dependency names

```bash
YEARS=$(shell seq 1900 2015)
YOB=$(addprefix data/raw/yob,$(YEARS))
YOBTXT=$(addsuffix .txt,$(YOB))
```

* `shell seq` generates a numbers between 1900 & 2015
* `addprefix` adds prefix (`data/raw/yob`) to each value of `YEARS`
* `$(YEARS)` is how we get the values of the `YEARS` array
* `addsuffix` adds suffix (`.txt`) to each value of `YOBTXT`

---

## Back to the Makefile

* Add those three lines to the top of the Makefile
* After those lines, convert this to a rule...

```bash
# Concatenate the annual baby name data
# Depends on: data/raw/yob????.txt files
#							code/concatenate_files.R
# Producees:	data/processed/all_names.csv
R -e "source('code/concatenate_files.R')"
```

--

<br>
... like so ...

<br>

```bash
data/processed/all_names.csv : code/concatenate_files.R $(YOBTXT)
	R -e "source('code/concatenate_files.R')"
```

---

## And convert this

```bash
# Depends on: website data at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip
# Produces: slew of files named yob????.txt and a pdf file
wget --no-check-certificate -P data/raw/ https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip
unzip -d data/raw/ data/raw/names.zip
```

--

<br>

to this...

```bash
# Depends on: website data at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip
# Produces: slew of files named yob????.txt and a pdf file
$(YOBTXT) :
	wget --no-check-certificate -P data/raw/ https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip
	unzip -d data/raw/ data/raw/names.zip
```

---

## Sweet.

<br>Try this...

```bash
$ make family_report.html
make: `family_report.html' is up to date.
```

--
<br>What do you think will happen if we try this?
```bash
$ rm data/processed/alive_2016_annual.csv
$ make family_report.html
```

---

## Common errors

```bash
$ make family_report.html
Makefile:23: *** missing separator.  Stop.
```

You used spaces instead of a tab to inset your commands

--

<br>

```bash
$ make family_report.html
make: *** No rule to make target `family_reportRmd', needed by `family_report.html'.  Stop.
```

You mistyped the name of the dependency

--

<br>

```bash
$ make family_reporthtml
make: *** No rule to make target `family_reporthtml'.  Stop.
```

You mistyped the name of the target

---

YEARS=$(shell seq 1900 2015)
YOB=$(addprefix data/raw/yob,$(YEARS))
YOBTXT=$(addsuffix .txt,$(YOB))

family_report.html : family_report.Rmd\
					code/plot_functions.R\
					data/processed/total_and_living_name_counts.csv
	R -e "library(rmarkdown); render('family_report.Rmd')"
```

---

## PHONY Rules

```bash
.PHONY: clean
clean :
	rm -f $(RAW)/*txt
	rm -f $(RAW)/*pdf
	rm -f $(RAW)/*zip
	rm -f data/processed/*.csv
	rm -f family_report.html
```

* There's no target named "clean" - this is a phony rule
* What happens if you run `make clean`?

---

## We can attempt to make the code DRY with variables

```bash
RAW = data/raw
PROCESSED = data/processed
```

<br>
We can call these by using `$(RAW)` or `$(PROCESSED)`

```bash
YOB=$(addprefix data/raw/yob,$(YEARS))
```

becomes...

```bash
YOB=$(addprefix $(RAW)/yob,$(YEARS))
```

<br>
Where else can you replace `data/raw` and `data/processed`?

---

## Automatic Variables

* `$@`: the target
* `$^`: all dependencies for current rule
* `$<`: first dependency
* `$*`: pattern match

<br>
Can you now rewrite this?

```bash
data/processed/all_names.csv : code/concatenate_files.R $(YOBTXT)
	R -e "source('code/concatenate_files.R')"
```

--
<br>

```bash
data/processed/all_names.csv : code/concatenate_files.R $(YOBTXT)
	R -e "source('$<')"
```

<br>

---

## Pattern matching

```bash
print-% :
	@echo "$*= $($*)"
```

<br>
The `%` matches a pattern. This is a weird example
<br>

--

<br>
```bash
$ make print-YOBTXT
YOBTXT= data/raw/yob1900.txt data/raw/yob1901.txt data/raw/yob1902.txt
data/raw/yob1903.txt data/raw/yob1904.txt data/raw/yob1905.txt data/raw/yob1906.txt
data/raw/yob1907.txt data/raw/yob1908.txt data/raw/yob1909.txt data/raw/yob1910.txt
data/raw/yob1911.txt data/raw/yob1912.txt...
```

<br>
Having this rule in my Makefile is helpful when I'm doing complex things like build `YOBTXT`

---

## Other commands

* `make -n target`: What commands will be run to build the target?
* `make -d target`: What dependencies need to be fulfilled to build the target?
* `make –j N target`: Use N processors to build target
* `make`: Build first rule in Makefile
* `make –f my_makefile`: Use my_makefile in place of Makefile

???

make -n is helpful to give you a dry run before running make to double check that you aren't going to be re running your entire project!

---

## General "design" thoughts

* Scripts are better than command line calls in the Makefile. The Makefile isn't a dependency!

```bash
$(YOBTXT) :
	wget -nc --no-check-certificate -P $(RAW) https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip
	unzip -u -d $(RAW) $(RAW)/names.zip
```

<br>

???
If I change the url, will anything change when I run `make family_report.html`?

--

* Make scripts specific to one function. This minimize the scope of the dependency tree. If you change one script, you will affect far fewer downstreame files

???

If all of my figure generating code is in one script and I change the code for one figure, I'll have to regenerate all of the figures

* [Software carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/)
* [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/)
* [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)

---

## Let's turn back to Kozich
* In the project directory there is already a `Makefile`
  * Can you identify the variables?
  * Can you see the rules for the bash commands you put into `analysis_driver.bash`?
  * Does anything need to be edited for this project?
  * What is missing?
--

* Go ahead and see if you can adapt this Makefile for the Kozich project based on what you learned from the name example
* Rememeber that `make -n <TARGET>` allows you to do a dry run

---

## What happens if...

<br>

```bash
make -n data/references/silva.seed.align
```
--

<br>

```bash
make -n results/figures/nmds_figure.png
```
--

<br>


```bash
make -n write.paper
```
--

<br>

```bash
rm results/figures/nmds_figure.png
make -n write.paper
```
--

<br>

```bash
rm data/references/silva.seed.align
make -n write.paper
```

---

## Final touches

* Write a PHONY target: `clean`
* Commit!
* Run `make clean; make`
* For all the marbles...

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013
git clone ...
cd Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013
make write.paper
```

---

## One last thing...

* Another version of the same samples from a separate sequencing run is available at the same website
* What would you change in the Makefile to re-run the analysis?
* How could you test the effect of the change to the overall analysis?

---

## A solution

* Edit and run the rule to obtain the raw data
* Run `make write.paper`
* Run `git diff-word manuscript.md`
