# Contributing to the Riffomonas Reproducible Research tutorial series

We love to get feedback and improvements from others. That's the idea behind Riffomonas - that we riff on each other's work to make it better! If you would like to contribute to the project or even ask a question, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/riffomonas/reproducible_research/issues">file an issue</a> on our <a href="https://github.com/riffomonas/reproducible_research">GitHub repository</a>. A few preliminary thoughts before you post...

* Be nice. We follow the [Code of Conduct developed by The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
