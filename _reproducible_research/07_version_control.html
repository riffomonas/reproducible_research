---
## Learning goals

* Define and justfify the use of version control
* Differentiate between various version control approaches
* Apply version control to your project
* Construct meaningful descriptions of the differences between versions
* Look through the history of a project to see how a file has changed
* Integrate git and GitHub tooling to improve documentation of the evolution of an analysis

---

## Survey: Do you keep track of different versions of things?

* Do you back up your data or your code? Where? How?
* When have you needed to go to a backup?

???
* If they accidentally delete something
* If they somehow introduce a bug
* Dropbox / Box

---

## Survey: What is your current system for working with multiple versions?

* How do you keep track of different versions of your project?
* Where are these versions kept?
* How do you compare different versions?
* Do you know the differences between the versions?
* How difficult would it be to go back to a previous version?

???
* Expect things like track changes or compare versions in Word (not helpful for Excel)

## Case study: Scenario

As an graduate student you were taught proper methods for keeping a laboratory notebook. You were perhaps told to give each experiment a title, rationale, hypothesis, description of methods, data, results, and a conclusion. Now you have been given a project that involves analyzing 10 million 16S rRNA gene sequences. How will you change your lab notebook practices?

---

## Case study: Questions

* How have you handled this situation in the past?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches?
* What if you needed to change a parameter setting or add new data?
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of paper vs. electronic notebooks for bench and computational science?

???

Take 5 minutes to jot down your answers to these questions

You are working on a manuscript and send it out to your PI. They're taking longer than hoped to get you feedback. In the meantime, you incorporate some comments from your labmates. Now you have a mess.

* The preceding discussions are prime opportunities to use git
* git is a version control system. Others exist including subversion and mercurial
* A major difficulty with this, however, is teaching collaborators how to use git or GitHub
* I don't have any silver bullets to solve the issue with collaborators, but throughout this tutorial and others we'll see some strategies make it easier

---

## `git` and GitHub

* GitHub is a web service built upon `git` - GitHub is ***not*** `git`

--
* Public repositories are free on GitHub

--
* If you are an academic and contact GitHub, you can have unlimited private repositories

--
* Can create a group account for your lab (e.g. [SchlossLab](https://github.com/SchlossLab)) as a final resting place for lab project and papers

--
* `git` is hard, but you can do it and GitHub goes out of their way to make it easier

???

* BitBucket is another web service built upon git
---

## You're already a `git` pro!

* During the paper airplane activity you made a *commit*
* In starting the Kozich reanalysis project you created a repository, added files to the repository, committed them, linked to a remote repository, and pushed your repository to GitHub
--

.center.alert[`git` can be frustrating and hard, but it really doesn't need to be]

---

## A word about customizing `git`

* Many ways to configure git to look and behave the way you'd like
* Some things need to be done from the outset

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Pat Schloss"
$ git config --global user.email "pat@schloss.org"
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
$ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
$ git config --global push.default simple
$ git config --list
```

* These commands will tell `git` your name, email address, how to color text, what [text editor to use for editing commit messages](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/), [how often to ask for your password](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-linux) (every hour), and will list out your `config` file

???

Go ahead and run these git config commands with your name and email address

---

## Another word about customizing `git`

* You can also create aliases for frequently used commands
* For exampe, I can't remember if it's `gif diff --word-diff` or `gif diff --diff-word`. Plus typing all that stuff is tedious.

```bash
$ git config --global alias.diff-word 'diff --word-diff'
```

--
* `git`'s [online materials](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) give other examples of aliases you can use to cut down on your typing
* Beware that sometimes it's harder to remember the alias than the actual command

---

## Let's create a silly project to emphasize some concepts

* Create a new directory in your `~/` directory that we'll call `silly_repository`

```bash
cd ~/
mkdir silly_repository
cd silly_repository
```

* Within `sill_repository` create a `README.md` file add some text

```bash
# README
Waistcoat vegan selvage sartorial polaroid pok pok. Synth DIY banh mi fixie, green juice
keytar four loko kogi lo-fi twee. Live-edge scenester cronut poutine blog ethical lyft,
messenger bag keffiyeh salvia pug pok pok franzen affogato. Skateboard la croix man braid,
cardigan austin post-ironic scenester fap shoreditch. Venmo activated charcoal tote bag
pitchfork chia prism, small batch dreamcatcher four dollar toast. Disrupt cold-pressed
biodiesel pok pok. Synth microdosing locavore offal, XOXO mustache sartorial.
```

## Let's create a repository.

How did we do it before?

--

```bash
git init .
```
<br>
--

At the prompt, type `ls -a`

```bash
$ ls -a
.		..		.git		README.md
```
<br>
--

Hmmm, let's see what's inside of `.git`

```bash
$ ls .git
HEAD		config		hooks		objects
branches	description	info		refs
```

---

## What's going on?

* `git init .` creates a repository
* You know the directory is a repository because your directory contains the `.git` directory
* The contents of `.git` help `git` to keep track of your changes and history
--

* YOU DO NOT NEED TO LOOK INSIDE THIS DIRECTORY
--

* DO NOT DELETE `.git` unless you want to nuke your repository

---

## Concepts behind `git`

* Text based (won't work the way you want with `docx`, `pdf`, or `xlsx` files)
--

* `git` keeps track of the changes, who made the changes, and when they were made
--

* Once something is put (i.e. commited) into the repository, it is *very* hard to remove it
  * This is good because it's hard to really screw up
  * This is bad because if you accidently commit a large file or sensitive information it can be hard to remove

---

## Let's check the status of our respository

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

* There's a lot here, but let's focus on what's immediately of interest
  * This will be our "Initial commit"
  * We have one "Untracked files"
  * We don't have anything to commit at this time
--

* Uhhh, that's a lot of jargon
---

## Break it down

.center[![git repository structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swc-git-staging-area.svg)]
.footnote[[Image credit: Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/)]

???
Ask learners if they know where README.md currently resides in this schematic - it's the document to the left, outside of `.git`

--

* Right now, the `silly_repository` repository is empty
* `.git` is empty
* There is one file that `git` sees that is within the directory, but outside `.git` - `README.md`


---

## Break it down

.center[![git repository structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swc-git-staging-area.svg)]
.footnote[[Image credit: Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/)]

<br>

We did get instructions on how to add `README` to `.git`

```bash
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
```
--

Let's do it

```bash
git add README.md
```

???
* Ask learners if they know where README.md currently resides in this schematic
* It's in the staging area

---

## Break it down

.footnote[[Image credit: Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/)]

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   README.md
```

Again it gives us instructions on what to do to commit the file or to unstage it

---

## Break it down

.footnote[[Image credit: Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/)]

* We don't want to unstage it, we want to commit it
* Commmitting the file will add it to the repository

--

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add a README that any hipster would be proud of"
[master (root-commit) 6853ad3] Add a README that any hipster would be proud of
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

???
* Ask learners if they know where README.md currently resides in this schematic
* It's in the repository

---

## Break it down

.center[![git repository structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swc-git-staging-area.svg)]

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

* BOOM - well done!
* This is exactly<sup>*</sup> what we did with the paper airplane example in the earlier tutorial

.footnote[<sup>*</sup> except that GitHub did it all for us]

.alert[Show some enthusiasm!<br>When I use `git`, 90% of the time I am using:<br>
`git status`, `git add`, or `git commit`]

---

## Oh, right this is a university, we need to be serious

* Use a text editor and edit your `README.md` file to make a little bit of sense and be sure to save the file
* Then run `git status`
* Where are you in the following diagram?

.center[![git repository structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/swc-git-staging-area.svg)]

The center - it's in the staging area since it was previously committed, but has beene edited

---

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

* We are in the repository, but our changes have not been staged to commit.
* As it says, we can either `git add` the file to stage it and commit the file or we can use `checkout` to discard the changes
	* Why might we want to discard the changes?
	* If we discard the changes will we get them back?
	* How far back will the changes be discarded?

---

## Before we commit the changes let's check something out

```bash
$ git diff README.md
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

## Hmmm. Can we make this any more useful?

If we look at the help for `git diff`, by doing

```
git diff --help
```
--
we'll see this:

```bash
       --word-diff[=<mode>]
           Show a word diff, using the <mode> to delimit changed words. By default,
           words are delimited by whitespace; see --word-diff-regex below. The <mode>
           defaults to plain, and must be one of:

           color
               Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies --color.

           plain
               Show words as [-removed-] and {+added+}. Makes no attempts to escape the
               delimiters if they appear in the input, so the output may be ambiguous.

           porcelain
               Use a special line-based format intended for script consumption.
               Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified diff
               format, starting with a +/-/` ` character at the beginning of the line
               and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
               represented by a tilde ~ on a line of its own.
```

---

## Let's give that a shot...

```bash
$ git --word-diff README.md

## Let's add and commit the changes

```bash
$ git add README.md

---

## We can see what we've done using the `git log` command:

```bash
$ git log

    Make the README content a bit more serious

commit 6853ad3ff9242b6ed1999dd5060c94be51a2a04d
Author: Pat Schloss <pschloss@umich.edu>
Date:   Wed Feb 22 14:49:38 2017 -0500

    Add a README that any hipster would be proud of
```

This gives a reverse chronological ordering of your commits. You can explore the `git log --help` output to see all the ways you can customize the output.

---

## Exercise

`git diff` is a powerful tool that allows you to see how your file has changed over time. What do the following versions of the command do?

```
git diff README.md
git diff HEAD README.md
git diff HEAD^1 README.md
git diff 824d1786bbc8514fb260a38db63470d0fdcb6f49 README.md
```

## [A word about commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)<sup>*</sup>

.left-column[
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
8. Um, [keep it PG](http://librestats.com/2014/07/30/f-bombs-in-github-commits-warning-contains-profanity/)
]

.right-column[
![XKCD comic of git commit messages]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/git_commit_2x.png)
]

.footnote[<sup>*</sup>Some of these are beyond where we currently are<br>Source: [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1296/)]

???

* What we put in the quotes of `git commit -m "something clever"` is the subject.
* I find it useful to re-read this web page frequently to assess how useful my commit messages are

---

## Exercise

* Copy the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) into `silly_repository` to create LICENSE.md
* Edit the license to add the year and your full name
* Add to the repository using our commit workflow
* Create a GitHub repository and push your `silly_repository` to GitHub
* On the GitHub version, add your PI's name to the license
* Back in the terminal, type `git pull`
* What happened?

---

## Commits: How often?

* I like to avoid using "and" in my commit messages to force my commits to be about one thing
--

* You can generate bigger commit messages by doing `git commit` without the `-m "Something clever"`. This will open the text editor. Type the subject of the commit on the first line. Leave a blank line and then write a fuller description of what you did. Save and close the window.
--

* I also like to make a commit before I'm about to do anything risky so I have a fall back position (kind of like saving Word before running Endnote)
---

## Pushes: How often?

* You can `push` your commits as often as you want
* Ideally at the end of a work session to have a back up
* Remember to `pull` if you've changed something on GitHub (i.e. the remote) before you `push` again

---

## Let's return to our Kozich re-analysis

Check the status of our repository

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md
	modified:   code/README.md
	modified:   data/raw/README.md
	modified:   data/references/README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	code/mothur/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

---

## Stage our changes

* We don't want the `mothur` files in the repository since it's a large, bulky binary file, that we're unlikely to change
* Stage the `README.md` files to the repository
* Check the status

--

```bash
$ git add README.md code/README.md data/raw/README.md data/references/README.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   README.md
	modified:   code/README.md
	modified:   data/raw/README.md
	modified:   data/references/README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	code/mothur/
```

---

## Commit our changes

Let's make a more detailed commit message

```bash
$ git commit
```
--

Inside the text editor...

```bash
Insert code into README files

Obtained mothur executable, raw fastq.gz files, and silva and
RDP reference files
```
--
<br>
Let's see how this looks...

```bash
$ git log
commit c34b2b7fc14a29ce499fbf0cfa1606c5fa2c05a5
Author: Pat Schloss <pschloss@umich.edu>
Date:   Wed Feb 22 16:19:36 2017 -0500

    Insert code into README files

    Inserted code that shows how we obtained mothur executable, raw
    fastq.gz files, and silva and RDP reference files
```

---

## Where are we at?

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	code/mothur/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

* We can keep going with our project and pretend that the `code/mothur` line isn't there whenever we run `git status`
* Or we could ask `git` to ignore it for us!

---

## Ignoring is bliss...

* Did you notice that there seem to be a bunch of files that `git` is already ignoring?
  * The `fastq.gz` files in `data/raw`
  * The reference files in `data/references`
--

* On the GitHub page, did you notice a file named `.gitignore`? What do you think that does?

---

## `.gitignore`

```
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData

.DS_Store

data/*/*
!data/process/*
!README.md

*.qsub*
mothur*logfile
*temp*
*.docx
```

* This file tells `git` to ignore any file or directory that matches a line of this file
* Except! It will not ignore those files/directories that start with a `!`

---

## Will our `.gitignore` ignore these and why?

* `data/process`
* `data/raw/README.md`
* `figures/figure_1.png`
* `mothur.1234567890.logfile`
* `data/mothur/mice.filter`
* `submission/my_awesome_paper.docx`
* `README.md`

???

* `data/process` - no - !data/process/*
* `data/raw/README.md` - yes - data/*/*
* `figures/figure_1.png` - no
* `mothur.1234567890.logfile` - yes - mothur*logfile
* `data/mothur/mice.filter` - yes - data/*/*
* `submission/my_awesome_paper.docx` - yes - *.docx
* `README.md` - no

---

## How do we ignore `code/mothur`?

* `code`
* `code/mothur`
* `mothur`
* `figures/mothur`

<br>

* Add what you think is the correct line to `.gitignore` and re-run `git status`
* What changed? Did you get it right?

???
* It's `code/mothur`
* code would ignore all of our code
* mothur would work, but would ignore any other directory you have called mothur
* figures/mothur will ignore the mothur directory inside your figures directory, not your code directory

---

## Checking out the effects of `.gitignore`

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   .gitignore

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

* Cool. It's now ignoring `code/mothur`
* We've modified `.gitignore` so we need to stage and commit that file. Can you do that?

---

## Add, commit, status, push

```bash
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Ignore mothur software"
[master 117ef64] Ignore mothur software
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.

## Safe `git`

* You can add all of the files in your directory to the repository
  * This can be efficient
  * This result in committing large files, temp files, passwords, random crap that you don't want
  * Add one file at a time
* You could use wild cards to add several files at once
  * [NO](https://imgur.com/ybFghGD).
* Before typing `git commit`, force yourself to run `git status` and make sure you have staged what you want and only what you want

## Removing things from your repository

You are reorganizing your repository and you no longer need a file, but you want to retain its history:

```
$ git rm code/old_script.R
$ git commit -m "Remove old script file"
```

If you don't include the `git`, then you'll run into problems. Best to do:

```
git checkout -- code/old_script.R
git rm code/old_script.R
git commit -m "Remove old script file"
```

## Moving things in your repository

Say you are reorganizing your repository and you want to move or rename a file

```
git mv code/my_script.R git mv code/generate_figure4.R
git commit -m "Rename script file"
```

<br>
By doing this you will be able to track the history of the file from `code/generate_figure4.R` back through its time as `code/my_script.R`

## Removing things from your repository

* You accidentally included a large file or files with sensitive information (e.g. passwords) in your repository, but you haven't pushed it.

```
	git filter-branch --force --index-filter\
	 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch data/raw/really_big_file.txt'\
	 --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

* You accidentally included a **large file** or files with **sensitive information** in your repository, but you have pushed it. This requires [big league help](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/)

.center.alert[In both cases the offending file will be deleted, back it up before pursuing these options]

* Add changes to README.md (already in your repository)
* Push changes to your repository
* Check the status of your repository

2. git mv REDME.md README.md
3. git log
4. git add my_code.R
5. git add README.md
6. git push
