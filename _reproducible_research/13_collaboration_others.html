## Learning goals

* Expand use of Gitflow workflow for teamwork (with yourself or an actual team)
* Make a pull request to incorporate new code
* Integrate an external review of your code into Gitflow workflow
* Apply many of the principles that we've been working on throughout series of tutorials

---

## The annoying postdoc in the lab has a great idea...

.left-column[
* Postdoc: You're using R's base graphics? You should be using the tidyverse!
* You: Meh. I have a plot, it says what I want...
* Postdoc: It'd be really easy, you should totally change your code.
* You: Make a pull request and I'll think about it
]

---

## Pull requests

* Pull requests (PRs) are a mechanism that allow others to contribute to your project, but that give you (or someone you designate) the power to accept or reject the contribution
* The PR can be discussed between you and the contributor and allow the contributor to make changes before you accept the contribution

---

## Pull requests and Gitflow

* As a project gets bigger or more public, more people might want to contribute
* Can delegate issues to different contributors
* Don't want all contributors to have the ability to merge to the `master` branch
* Even on a projet with a single developer, you may not want to be able to merge changes to `master` without someone seeing your code

---

## New concepts that we'll discuss before we're done

* Fork
* Upstream
* Pull request
* Code review

---

## Extension of Gitflow

1. Fork of a repository into your own GitHub account
2. Claim an issue from the primary copy of the project repository. Alternatively, file an issue and ask developer whether they would be interested in a PR on this issue.
3. Create a branch from your copy where you will work on the changes
4. Make and commit necessary changes to your copy
5. Merge upstream copy back into your copy to resolve differences
6. Push your copy up to your GitHub account
7. File a pull request
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until developers accept your PR

---

.center[![Create an organization for your research group]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/new_organization.png)
]

* If you don't already have an account for your lab, go ahead and create one
* My group already has one that we use to support each of our manuscripts
* You can tell GitHub that you and your organzation are at an academic institution and get unlimited free private repositories (make them public when you submit your papers!)

???

Note that you can make a pull request to a repository owned by an individual who isn't part of an organization. We're doing it to an organization to get your lab group on GitHub!

## Phew...

* Let's recap what we've just done...
  * Created an organization for our research group
  * Transfered ownership from our personal account to our lab (A Good Idea&trade;)
--

* This may seem like a bit much for a project where you are the only researcher, but...
  * Sets up a layer of organization that can reduce errors
  * Creates a structure where others in your group (e.g. annoying postdoc, awesome PI, etc) can review your code
  * Reinforces best practices for contributing to other projects

## Getting a local copy - two options

1. Your local repository is already looking for the remote (i.e. GitHub) repository in your account
--

1. Alternatively (and perhaps better), you could *clone* the repository into your local directory
  * Delete your `Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013` directory
```
cd ~/
rm -rf Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013
```
  * Click the green "Clone or download" button and press the copy button:
```
git clone https://github.com/pschloss/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git
```
  * Re-render data
```
make write.paper
```

???
* Option 2 is the preferred approach because it makes sure that you're off to a fresh start.
* Option 1 is probably fine for this case
* Option 2 is what you would do if you were to collaborate on someone else's project

---

## What is the `remote`?

* You have been working on your *local* version of the repository on AWS
* The *remote* version is what is on GitHub and is under your account (e.g. pschloss)
* We need a second remote, *upstream*, that tells git what the version upstream or the parent of our repository

---

## Looking at the remotes

```
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/pschloss/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/pschloss/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git (push)
```

--
<br/>
## Let's set our upstream remote

```
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/SchlossLab/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/pschloss/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/pschloss/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/SchlossLab/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/SchlossLab/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013.git (push)
```

---

## Fetching and pulling

* Doing it in two steps...
  * A `fetch` brings down a the commits from the remote branch that are not in your current branch and stores them locally
  * A `merge` will integrate the commits from the remote branch into your local branch
  * Allows you to manage potential conflicts
--

* Doing it in one step...
  * A `pull` will both fetch and merge the remote commits
  * If you aren't keeping track of things closely, a `pull` may result in numerous conflicts
--

* In the original version control tutorial we used `pull` since we were the only one working on the remote version - this would still be the case with the version in your account, but may not be the case with your upstream branch
---

## What this looks like...

<br/>
```
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git pull origin
Already up-to-date.
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git fetch upstream
From https://github.com/SchlossLab/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013
 * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git merge upstream/master
Already up-to-date.
```

--
### Note that instead of the git `pull command`, you could also do

```
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git fetch origin
ubuntu@ip-172-30-0-164:~/Kozich_ReAnalysis_AEM_2013$ git merge origin

## Issue 4

1\. Create the issue in GitHub on the upstream repository (e.g. the one in SchlossLab)
--

.center[![:scale Create the issue in GitHub on the upstream repository, 75%]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/issue_004.png)]

## Set guidelines for making contributions

* Community and behavioral expectations.
* Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
* Steps for creating good issues or pull requests ([Checklist from Mozilla](https://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/contrib.html)):
  * Maximum submission length of 400 lines
  * Maximum function length of 50 lines
  * Code must be automatically merged
  * All tests must pass and all functions must be tested
  * All functions must be documented
  * Respect the style guide
  * Indicate what issue this contribution addresses
  * Summarize and annotate changes

---

---

## Code review

* Think of it as peer review for your code
* [Get over the quality of your code](http://www.academichermit.com/2016/01/04/Suck-until-you-dont.html) - that's the purpose of having a review!
* Think about what you want out of code review - what is the goal?
* Solicit reviews from your PI, collaborators, colleagues, random strangers
* Do it [early and often](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5648v2.pdf) to prevent code backlog to get the best feedback
* Keep it [under 500 lines of code](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/)
* Review can be live (i.e. in a lab meeting) or asynchronus (more like peer review for a paper)

---

## Reviewing a contribution

* Intrinsic Examination
  * Are functions as simple as possible?
  * Is the code efficient?
  * Is the usage of each function clear?
  * Have edge cases been considered?

* Extrinsic Examination
  * Does the new code reinvent any wheels?
  * Does the new code successfully address the needs of the project?
  * Does the new code respect the structure of the project?

## Exercise

* Based on what you've learned in this series of tutorials, why should the "final" version of your repository be in your group's organization account and not just your private account?
* Looking around the GitHub version of your lab's copy of the repositoryl, How would you add someone from your lab to review your code?
* Who could provide a review of your code?

---

## Get a "virtual" badge for completing these tutorials

* You will need to add yourself to the "Honor Roll"
* To do this...
  * Fork a copy of the [repository](https://github.com/riffomonas/reproducible_research.git) that supports this website
  * Create a local copy of the repository
  * Add a file that is named `your_github_id.yml` (e.g. `pschloss.yml`) that is a copy of `_honor_roll/_template.yml` to `_honor_roll` directory
  * Complete the needed information
	* Add your picture (needs to be 300 pixels by 300 pixels) as `your_github_id.jpg` to `_honor_roll` directory
  * Add the changes to your copy of the respository
  * Create pull request
  * After it has been accepted you will see your information on the [honor roll](../honor_roll/) page
