## Learning goals

* Justify the value of doing open science
* Identify the steps you can take to maximize the discoverability of your work

---

## Case study: Leeuwenhoek's 'Concerning Little Animals'

* Revolutionized microbiology because of his microscope and precise grinding of lenses
--

* His descriptions of little animals aroused suspicion
  * Wrote in low Dutch, which had to be translated to English and was heavily edited
  * Refused to give any description of his methods
  * Actively discouraged teaching people his methods of grinding lenses
--

* Hooke, Huygens, others were initially unable to reproduce his work
  * Hooke eventually validated Leeuwenhoek's results
  * Was able to use this experience to popularize compound microscope design
  * Leeuwenhoek's microscopes that were possibly better than Hooke's were forgotten

## Science done in the open has a bigger impact

* These papers are better cited
* Easier for others to build off your work
* Builds transparency - a critical component of reproducible research

---

## Tools we have to maximize openness of your work

<div style="float:right;">
![:scale Make your research open!, 100%]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/open_access.png)
</div>

* Licenses and Copyrights
* Public vs. private repositories
* `CITATION.md` file
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` file
* Make your repository discoverable
  * URL in paper
  * Tagging your repository
* Preprints
* Publish in Open Access journals

---

## Licenses and Copyrights

* If a license or copyright are not provided with code or text, it is presumed to be closed source with all rights remaining with the author (i.e. not open)
* Do not write a license from scratch unless you are a lawyer (even then, why?)
* Numerous options are availble and this can be confusing
	* https://choosealicense.com
	* https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/
  * https://opensource.org/licenses
  * https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html
  * https://opensource.guide/legal/

---

## Legalese

* Copyright declares and proves who owns the intellectual property (the code, text, etc.) and exists without you asserting it
* Licensing describes the terms under which people are allowed to use the copyrighted material and you have to grant it to others

---

## Important points

* If you include other people's code in your code and it has the [General Public License (GPL)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), then your code must be licensed with the GPL as well
* You are highly unlikely to make any money off of your code
* A closed or restrictive license is more likely to reduce the number of citations than a more open license
* Creative Commons licenses (e.g. CC-BY) [do not cover source code](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1717/why-is-cc-by-sa-discouraged-for-code)

---

## What do we do in the Schloss Lab?

* Generally uses the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for our code
  * Requires all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the license and the copyright notice
  * We still retain copyrights
* Papers and preprints use the [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
  * Require attribution
  * Allows others to do whatever they want with the material

## Public vs. private repositories

* Private repositories allow you to restrict who can see your work
* GitHub gives academic users [unlimited private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/discounted-organization-accounts/)
* It is OK to work with a private repository, but make it **_public_** before submitting your manuscript
* The odds of anyone scooping you if you work in a public repository are very low. Probably more likely that you get unsolicited help

???

* I typically work in public, but much of my lab prefers to work in private
* All of mothur development is done publicly

## `CITATION.md` file

Add a file called `CITATION.md` to the root of your GitHub repository that tells people how to cite your work

```
To reference this project in publications, please cite the following:

Kozich JJ, Westcott SL, Baxter NT, Highlander SK, Schloss PD. Development of a
dual-index sequencing strategy and curation pipeline for analyzing amplicon
sequence data on the MiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. Appl Environ Microbiol.

## `CONTRIBUTING.md` file

* We have already discussed the value of a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the previous tutorial
* Helps to direct community members to the standards that you expect them to follow in terms of behavior and coding
* Signals that you are looking for people to contribute to your project

---

## Make your repository discoverable

* Be sure to include the URL to your GitHub page in the manuscript
* Obtain a digital object identifier (DOI) for your repository
  - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org) is a service that interacts with GitHub to create a permanent link to your repository (i.e. no link rot)
  - Can version your DOIs so people can link to specific instances of your repository
  - The repository, not just the paper, becomes citable and those citations can be tracked
* Tagging your repository

## Preprints

* Traditional peer review process...
  * Your work is seen by 2 reviewers and an editor
  * Adversarial process
  * Secretive
  * Slow
* Preprints supplement peer review...
  * Open for anyone to see; high engagement
  * Collaborative
  * Public
  * Immediate
* [Learn more about preprints!](http://mbio.asm.org/content/8/3/e00438-17.full)

---

## Publish in Open Access journals!

* [Papers published with an open access model](http://www.nature.com/openresearch/about-open-access/benefits-for-authors/) have higher accessability, citation, likelihood of being built upon by others
* If you received NIH funding, a version must be publicly posted in [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
* There are a variety of models that journals use to make their work open access
* You retain copyright
* Can be expensive ([PeerJ: $1,095](https://peerj.com/pricing/); [ASM Journals: $2,300](http://msphere.asm.org/content/publication-fees); [Nature Communications: $5,200](http://www.nature.com/openresearch/publishing-with-npg/nature-journals/))

## Exercises

* Who owns the copyright of the last three papers published in your lab?
* Can you find the licenses used for R, mothur, and QIIME?
* Have a discussion with your PI and the rest of your lab regarding which software license you think best fits your projects
* Do your PI and research group have a preference for whether to publish your research under an open source license?
* Read and discuss the ideas put forth in "[Preprinting Microbiology](http://mbio.asm.org/content/8/3/e00438-17.full)" at one of your research group's lab meetings. What would it take to submit your next paper as a preprint? If you have already posted a preprint, what was your experience?
